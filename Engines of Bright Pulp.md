# Engines of Bright Pulp

- Track: 3
- Album: Into the Sloplands

## Lyrics

### Verse 1
Saints of wax weep crayons from their eyes,
Bellows of incense exhale plastic skies,
Drip‑choirs gargle a sherbet of psalms,
Rainbow ash sticks to the pits of my palms.

### Verse 2
Candy-bright porters shoulder past in files,
Bead-eyed cherubs stack bundles at my knees,
They press them into my arms: cracked teacups, orphaned keys,
Chewed crayons, busted trophies, doll teeth like seeds.

### Verse 3
Nursery-bright grinders take what I feed,
Lollipop augers slick planks that I lead,
Valve-choirs fog my sleeves with candy fizz,
Smile-stamped pistons punch circles on my wrists.

### Verse 4
From every maw, a sherbet river runs;
It climbs my shins in cadmium-curded tons,
Candy-magenta ropes slap bruise-green foam—
I wade the wrong rainbow, carried like scrap home.

### Bridge
But what are these wretched symbols?
On the machines? My mind, it spins...
And behind my writhing eyes, the vision,
of the Archive, where enlightenment begins...

### Chorus/Hook
Globules of horror!
a pustulent gulp!
engines of bright pulp!

### Spoken Interlude
> “By dawn’s light I found myself within this place. Lost already, yet no matter — for discovery demands it. Let him preen in his lecture halls! I shall return with wonders beyond imagining.”
